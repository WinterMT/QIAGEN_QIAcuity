# Counting Target Molecules: An R Tutorial
 This repository contains tutorial for the QIAGEN QIAcuity :registered: digital PCR machine by Winter Maxwell Thayer, MSPH. It is designed as a not-so-gentle introduction to the R statistical computing language that replicates analyses from the user manual for the machine, published in June, 2021. I welcome feedback and questions, do not hesitate to email me at wthayer1@jh.edu.
